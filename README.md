# Malware Classification Project

This project is aimed at classifying malware using machine learning techniques. It utilizes various Python libraries and a dataset from [MalwareData.csv](https://github.com/saurabh48782/Malware_Classification/blob/master/MalwareData.csv).

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- os
- joblib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- xgboost
- pefile
- math

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn joblib scikit-learn xgboost pefile
```
## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine.**

2. **Install the required libraries** as mentioned above.

3. **Run the provided code.**

## Code Overview

The code performs the following tasks:

- **Loading the Malware Dataset:** The code loads the dataset from the provided CSV file and separates legitimate software from malware.

- **Data Preparation for Machine Learning:** It prepares the data by extracting features and labels from the dataset.

- **Feature Selection:** Feature selection is done using an Extra Trees Classifier to select the most important features. The selected features are displayed, and their importance is visualized.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:** The code trains and evaluates machine learning models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifiers. You can manually adjust model parameters for optimization.

- **Saving the Models:** Functions are provided to save the trained models in Joblib files.

- **Executable File Analysis:** You can analyze executable files using the provided functions, extracting various features such as file size, imports, resources, and more.

- **Applying Models to Files:** The saved models are loaded, and you can use them to predict whether a given executable file is malware or not.

## Usage

You can use this code to analyze and classify executable files as either legitimate software or malware. Please refer to the code comments and functions for more details on each step.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the code:

```python
# Analyze an executable file
file_path = 'path_to_executable.exe'
pe_info = get_pefile_info(file_path, selected_feature_indices)

# Load the saved models
rf_model = load('./rf_model.joblib')
gb_model = load('./gb_model.joblib')
xgb_model = load('./xgb_model.joblib')

# Make predictions
rf_predictions = rf_model.predict(pe_info)
rf_probabilities = rf_model.predict_proba(pe_info)
print("The probability that the file is malware is", rf_probabilities[0][0] * 100, "%")
```

Feel free to explore and adapt the code for your specific needs.
